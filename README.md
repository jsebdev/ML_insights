# ML insights

This is a personal repository where I play with the different tools there are for data analysis and machine learning.

There is one folder for each topic. This repo is constantly growing and is not intended to be used as a portfolio project. But it's public in case I want to share it with someone or if you just want to see what I've been learning lately :\)
